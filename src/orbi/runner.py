"""One-shot bootstrap runner for Orbi.

This is intentionally small. It claims one ready GitHub Issue, gives it to
Pi in an isolated worktree, and accepts success only when one open PR exists.
After the implementer opens the PR, the Runner closes the loop itself: it
freezes the exact PR base/head SHA, runs one independent review session that
reviews the diff AND fixes Blocker/Major findings in the same session
(modify code, run tests, push the task branch — no cold-start
fixer, no third review), re-freezes the head after a clean verdict,
re-checks the merge gate against the latest remote base, and merges via
`gh pr merge --match-head-commit`. Pi never pushes the protected branch;
the Runner is the only merge actor. Any command failure is logged and
raised. There is no fallback, queue, daemon, or multi-agent framework.

Throughout the whole lifecycle the Runner publishes live progress
automatically: one per-run GitHub progress comment carrying a
hidden run marker is PATCHed in place on every activity change and at most
every 30 seconds while any Pi session (implementer or reviewer) runs, and
short milestone comments (plan ready, tests passed/failed, review findings,
merged, blocked) notify GitHub Mobile; started and PR-opened scene comments
also notify while remaining available for resume parsing. No human
command, poll or status check is part of the normal workflow.

      have a terminal label or be free of in-flight labels — a human
      closing an in-flight Issue leaves the label, and the scene survives
      until the delivery path resolves it. Terminal labels (`ai-merged` or
      `ai-blocked`) take precedence over stale in-flight labels.

    A closed Issue is never resumed (`pick_resumable_delivery` scans
    open Issues only) and nothing reads the task worktree after the

    the two body checks are skipped — an external PR body carries
    neither the run marker nor a `Fixes` keyword for this Issue; the
    Issue is closed by the Runner after the merge instead. When
    `pr_repo` is given (resume path), a Runner-owned PR's head repo must
    be that repo; an external takeover is selected by its trusted marker
    number and may have a fork head. When `expected_url` is given, the
    verified PR URL must exactly
    equal the recovered original PR URL (the resume must keep the
    same PR number). Issue #825/#1300: the marker check accepts ANY run
    marker of the delivery line — the marker set is read from the
    Issue's trusted comments when the current attempt's marker misses,
    because the PR body is written once by the creating run while a
    later attempt of the same line may bind a new run id. Both paths
    read the same source (`pr_repo` on the resume, the delivery's own
    source repo on the deliver path); the deliver path creates the PR
    only when none is open and verifies unconditionally, so a re-claim
    of an Issue whose PR an earlier run opened must not be rejected for
    owning its own PR.

    #82 removed the cold-start fixer together with the
    pre-Pi `verify_pr` of the old `resume_delivery` — the resume passed
    the comment's PR URL straight to the delivery wait while the review
    froze the PR derived from the run id, so the two lines could be
    different PRs (a comment must never steer the runner into the wrong
    PR). Restored: branch and worktree are DERIVED from the
    configured repo_dir, source repo, Issue number and run id (never
    read from the comment), the scene base must still equal the
    configured base — checked BEFORE any command runs — and
    a missing worktree is RECREATED from the remote delivery branch
    (the worktree is a local cache of the remote state —
    branch + PR live on GitHub — so a sandbox rebuild or a deleted
    cache is restored instead of looping; only a branch gone from the
    remote is unrecoverable). The existing
    `verify_pr` then validates exactly one open PR of the derived
    branch in the configured source repo, on the configured base,
    carrying the run marker and the `Fixes` keyword, with the EXACT URL
    of the recovered scene. `require_latest_base=False`: being behind
    the latest base is the expected state the review session absorbs
    in-session, so the base merge never returns to the
    runner. The returned URL is the one verify_pr verified — the
    delivery wait only ever sees verified URLs, never the comment
    string.

    A failure is classified: a RECOVERABLE failure
    (unpushed local commit, runner exception, ...) keeps the Issue in
    the automatic fix loop — `ai-fix-needed` with a run-marked failure
    comment carrying the full scene (run_id, PR, branch, worktree,
    session, phase, last activity, concrete error) on Issue AND PR —
    while an explicit `UnrecoverableDeliveryError` (an external
    precondition the AI cannot safely judge or fix, e.g. a base-branch
    config change) is terminal: the Issue is marked `ai-blocked` ALONE
    (the opened-PR state label is removed, and a leftover
    `ai-fix-needed` too) with the explicit reason why automatic
    recovery is impossible. The error is re-raised after reporting so
    the tick boundary can distinguish this handled external scene from
    an unhandled Runner bug; no review Pi is started, nothing is merged,
    and the PR, branch and worktree stay intact.

    read after the merge through the merge commit's parent chain
    (`M^1` is the base tip the PR merged into, `M^2` the PR head), so
    the merged PR head's objects never need to exist locally.
    `external_commits` subtracts the engine's own push history: the
    recorded last engine-pushed head (`pushed_head`; GitHub rejects
    non-fast-forward pushes, so the engine's heads form an ancestry
    chain and the per-interval union collapses to the last one), with
    `pushed_base` (the foreign head an external takeover starts from)
    excluded so the taken-over commits stay external. `0` means merged
    as-is.

    `external_commits` is the literal string `"unknown"` whenever the
    engine's push history cannot be proven — a missing/corrupt push
    record, a recorded head or base that is not an ancestor of the
    merged head — while `commits` keeps its proven count; both values
    are `"unknown"` only when a git read itself fails (a missing
    object, any git failure). A degraded metric must never fail a
    landed merge and never fabricate a `0`.

    A squash or rebase merge (Issue #1480) has no second parent, so the
    `M^1..M^2` window does not exist: both metrics are recorded as
    `"unknown"` directly, without a doomed git read.

    - editable: ``git rev-parse --show-toplevel`` at the import source

      or the resolved tag commit / exact SHA for the lock tracks. The
      09-07 scene (an editable install bound to an old issue worktree)
      fails here: worktrees share the fetched refs.
    - non-editable: the installed distribution version
      (importlib.metadata) must not be older than the channel's release
      tag — the latest tag reachable from the tracked branch ref, or the
      locked release/tag itself (resolved in the deployment home). A
      ``sha:`` lock cannot be mapped to a version and fails closed as
      unverifiable. Version equality or newer passes (a dev install
      ahead of the tags is not stale).

    unresolvable import source) fails the same way with a ``reason=``

    `title` is the issue's GitHub title: the review
    progress scenes (ensure, findings, merged) show `#<number> <title>`
    like every other scene; it is required, never fabricated.

    `scene` is the delivery's recovered resume scene (run_id, base,
    PR URL, `review_round`, `scene_at`): the round budget reads the
    scene's `review_round` field (the scene is the
    waiting primitive's state anchor), and every round comment carries
    the updated scene block, so the next resume continues the count.

    The delivery step calls this while the PR is open and the Issue
    awaits review (`ai-pr-opened`) or awaits the next review session
    (`ai-fix-needed`). It freezes the PR, runs the independent review
    (streamed, role=review), and then:

    - clean verdict -> the reviewer may have fixed findings IN THE SAME
      SESSION and pushed the task branch, so the PR is
      RE-FROZEN before the merge gate: the gate (latest-base ancestor,
      one-shot CI read, mergeable, head match,
      `gh pr merge --match-head-commit`) then runs against the head the
      verdict actually covers; confirm the merge landed on
      origin/<base>, sync the deployment checkout, label the Issue
      `ai-merged`; returns True. An EXTERNAL takeover (the scene marks
      `external`) NEVER merges: its clean verdict ends at the triage
      stop below — the review conclusion stays on the Issue and the
      ticket is labeled `ai-blocked` for the maintainer's acceptance
      decision (Issue #842, decision D2); returns False;
    - an intermediate gate state (CI still pending on the reviewed head,
      or mergeability still UNKNOWN) -> one journal line and return
      without a comment or a label change: "pending" is a
      state, not a failure — the next tick re-reads it, the round budget
      does not advance; returns False;
    - `blocked_on_human_decision` -> raise `HumanDecisionRequired` with
      the finding note and fix direction; the caller marks the Issue
      `ai-blocked` immediately, without recording another review round;
    - Blocker/Major findings the reviewer could not fix in-session ->
      comment them to Issue and PR (the comment carries the updated
      scene) and label the Issue `ai-fix-needed`; the next tick resumes
      the same PR with the next round — no cold-start fixer, no third
      review; returns False;
    - a gate failure because the head is behind the latest base, has a
      merge conflict, or its CI is red -> label the Issue
      `ai-fix-needed` with the finding (the next review session absorbs
      the latest base in-session or repairs the red CI); returns False;
    - missing/malformed verdict -> raise; the caller keeps the Issue in
      the automatic fix loop (`ai-fix-needed`). A mismatched head is
      recoverable when it names another real commit, and an unknown
      object gets two retries per review run before becoming terminal
      (`ai-blocked`);
    - an exhausted round budget -> raise `UnrecoverableDeliveryError`
      (the bounded loop is a human decision, not a
      recoverable failure); the caller marks the Issue `ai-blocked`
      with the explicit reason.

    The old `wait_for_delivery` held the slot in a sleep loop until the
    PR merged or failed, and the resume logic ran only when that process
    died — the most important path was the least-travelled one (Issue
    #788). The waiting primitive (#381/#763) is now the ONLY mechanism:
    this function performs at most ONE state transition per tick and
    returns; `main` releases the slot in its `finally`, and the next
    tick's `pick_resumable_delivery` classifies the same delivery
    RESUME_REVIEW and runs the next step. A crash loses at most the
    current Pi session, and the slot is held only while a Pi actually
    runs. No sleep exists on this path:

    - PR `MERGED` -> terminal: the delivery is done. An EXTERNAL
      takeover additionally closes the triage Issue with
      the merge evidence — the contributor's PR body carries no
      `Fixes #N` for this Issue, so GitHub never closes it natively
      (合并外部 PR 即关票); the close is bookkeeping of an already
      merged fact and its failure is logged, never a rewrite;
    - PR `CLOSED` without merge -> terminal failure: the Issue is
      marked `ai-blocked` (removing `ai-pr-opened`/`ai-fix-needed`)
      with a failure comment carrying the run marker. An EXTERNAL
      takeover is the exception: the contributor withdrew
      the PR or a maintainer rejected it — that is the 放弃/不可修
      fallback, so the Issue is requeued to `ai-ready` and the next
      claim redoes the fix internally;
    - CI pending on the open PR -> one `delivery_ci_pending` journal
      line, then return: "pending" is a state, not a sleep. The next
      tick re-reads it with one PR call (under the gh read retry and
      rate-limit guards); no label changes, no round consumed;
    - otherwise -> ONE review round (`_run_review_round`): the label
      read/repair, the resumable gate, the human acceptance gate
      (the waiting primitive returns the ticket to
      `ai-ready` while column 2 is non-empty), the independent review
      of the frozen PR — the only blocking phase, a Pi subprocess —
      and the merge gate, whose own intermediate states (pending CI,
      UNKNOWN mergeability) defer the merge to a later tick the same
      way. Findings or a failed gate leave `ai-fix-needed`; the next
      tick resumes the same run, branch, worktree and PR.
