"""Runner journal kernel: logging, run binding, and the subprocess seam.

Every journal line of a task attempt starts with `[run_id]`;
this module owns the logger that enforces it, the run-id binding the
filter reads, and the in-flight delivery scene the stop handler reports.
It also owns the ONE subprocess seam of Article 3.4: ``run_command`` and
its bounded git network retry.

This module imports nothing from the `orbi` package — it is the lowest
leaf, so `github` / `gitops` / `progress` / the extracted modules can all
share one seam and one logger without importing `runner`.
